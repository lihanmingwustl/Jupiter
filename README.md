The actual name of this project is: _Best Ticket_. 

It is a Java Web System which shows various ticket information based on their location.

They can find the best shows around them. When they find some tickets interesting, they could be able to set them as favourite. 

And with the Ticket Recommendation function, they could also see the recommended tickets for them.



### How I Did It?
• Designed	an	interactive	web	page	for	users	to	search	events	based	on	keywords	and	location	as	well	as	purchase	
tickets	utilizing	HTML,	CSS,	and	JavaScript.

• Implemented	several	Java	servlets using	RESTful	APIs to	handle	HTTP	requests	and	responses.

• Built	relational	and	NoSQL	databases	(MySQL,	MongoDB)	to	store event	data	from	TicketMaster	API.

• Designed	content-based	recommendation	algorithms to	implement event	recommendation.

• Deployed	server	to	Amazon	EC2 that	can	handle	150	qps	(tested	by	Apache	JMeter).
